# toomanyjokers
Adds a UI allowing for searching of cards.

Usage:
Press T to open TMJ.
Searches are loosely matched against many aspects of every card.
If a card checked in the search matches any of those, it will show up.
You can use multiple search terms by using commas. Virtually unlimited search terms are supported.
All provided search terms must match with a card for the card to show. (e.g. "+mult, xmult" will only show jokers that give both xmult and +mult, not any joker that gives either)

Credits to Dimserene for the idea to create this mod.
